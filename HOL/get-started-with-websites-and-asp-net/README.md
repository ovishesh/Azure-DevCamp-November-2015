# Getting started with Azure App Service Web Apps and ASP.NET

This lab shows how to create an ASP.NET web application and deploy it to an Azure App Service Web App by using Visual Studio 2015 Preview. It assumes that you have no prior experience using Azure or ASP.NET. On completing the lab, you will have a simple web application up and running in the cloud.

This lab includes the following sections:

1. [Create an ASP.NET web application in Visual Studio](#create-an-aspnet-web-application)
1. [Deploy the application to Azure](#deploy-the-application-to-azure)
1. [Make a change and redeploy](#make-a-change-and-redeploy)
1. [Monitor and manage the site in the preview portal](#monitor-and-manage-the-site-in-the-management-portal)
1. [Appendix - Cleanup](#cleanup)

## Create an ASP.NET web application

In this task you will create the web application that is going to be used throughout this lab.

1. Open Visual Studio. From the **File** menu, hover over the **New** option and click **Project**.

	![New Project in File menu](./images/newProject.png)

    _New Project in File menu_

2. In the **New Project** dialog box, expand **C#** and select **Web** under **Installed Templates**, and then select **ASP.NET Web Application**.

3. Name the application **ContactManager** and click **OK**.

	![New Project dialog box](./images/newProject-dialog.png)

    _New Project dialog box_

	>**Note:** Make sure you enter "ContactManager". Code blocks that you will be copying later assume that the project name is ContactManager.

4. In the **New ASP.NET Project** dialog box, select the **MVC** template. Verify **Authentication** is set to **Individual User Accounts**, **Host in the cloud** is checked and **Web App** is selected. Then, click **OK**.

	![New ASP.NET Project dialog box](./images/newProject-dialog-2.png)

    _New ASP.NET Project dialog box_

5. If you haven't already signed in to Azure, Visual Studio prompts you to do so. Click **Sign In**. Follow the prompts and provide your credentials.

	![Sign in to Azure](./images/sign-to-Azure.png)

    _Sign in to Azure_

6. The configuration wizard will suggest a unique name based on *ContactManager* (see the image below). Select a region near you. You can use [azurespeed.com](http://www.azurespeed.com/ "AzureSpeed.com") to find the lowest latency data center.
7. If you haven't created a database server before, select **Create new server**, enter a database user name and password.

	![Configure Azure Web App](./images/configure-azure1.png)

    _Configure Azure Web App_

	If you have a database server, use that to create a new database. Database servers are a precious resource, and you generally want to create multiple databases on the same server for testing and development rather than creating a database server per database. Make sure your Web App and database are in the same region.

8. Click **OK**.

	In a few seconds, Visual Studio creates the web project in the folder you specified, and it creates the Web App in the Azure region you specified.

	The **Solution Explorer** window shows the files and folders in the new project.

	![Solution Explorer](./images/solution-explorer.png)

	_Solution Explorer_

	The **Azure App Service Activity** window shows that the Web App has been created.

	![Web App created](./images/web-publish-view.png)

	_Web App created_

	And you can see the Web App and database in **Server Explorer**.

	> **Note:** if the Server Explorer window is not open, you can open it from the **View** menu.

	![Web App created](./images/server-explorer.png)

    _Web App created_

## Deploy the application to Azure

1. In the **Azure App Service Activity** window, click **Publish ContactManager to this Web App now**.

	![Web App created](./images/web-publish-view-2.png)

    _Azure App Service Activity Window_

	In a few seconds the **Publish Web** wizard appears.

	The settings that Visual Studio needs to deploy your project to Azure have been saved in a *publish profile*. The wizard enables you to review and change those settings.

2. In the **Connection** tab of the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Validate Connection** to make sure that Visual Studio can connect to Azure in order to deploy the web project.

	![Validate connection](./images/validate-connection.png)

    _Validating the connection_

	When the connection has been validated, a green check mark is shown next to the **Validate Connection** button.

3. Click **Next**.

	![Successfully validated connection](./images/validate-connection-2.png)

	_Successfully validated connection_

4. The **Settings** tab is shown. If you expand **File Publish Options** you will see several settings that enable you to handle scenarios that don't apply to this lab:

	* **Remove additional files at destination**.

		Deletes any files at the server that aren't in your project. You might need this if you were deploying a project to a site that you had deployed a different project to earlier.

	* **Precompile during publishing**.

		Can reduce first-request warm up times for large sites.

	* **Exclude files from the App_Data folder**.

		For testing you sometimes have a SQL Server database file in App_Data which you don't want to deploy to production.

	In this case, keep the default values for **Configuration** and **File Publish Options** and click **Next**.

	![Settings tab](./images/publishing-settings.png)

    _Settings tab_

5. In the **Preview** tab, click **Start Preview**.

	![StartPreview button in the Preview tab](./images/start-preview.png)

	_Start Preview button - Preview tab_

	The tab displays a list of the files that will be copied to the server. Displaying the preview isn't required to publish the application but it's a useful function to be aware of.

6. Click **Publish**.

	![StartPreview file output](./images/click-publish.png)

	_File Preview_

	Visual Studio begins the process of copying the files to the Azure server.

	The **Output** and **Azure App Service Activity** windows show what deployment actions were taken and report successful completion of the deployment.

	![Azure App Service Activity](./images/publish-output.png)

    _Azure App Service Activity reporting successful deployment_

	![Output window](./images/output-window.png)

	  _Output Window reporting successful deployment_

	Upon successful deployment, the default browser automatically opens to the URL of the deployed Web App, and the application that you created is now running in the cloud. The URL in the browser address bar shows that the site is being loaded from the Internet.

	![Web App running in Azure](./images/publish-success.png)

	_Web App running in Azure_

7. Close the browser.

## Make a change and redeploy

In this task, you will change the **h1** heading of the home page, run the project locally on your development computer to verify the change, and then deploy the change to Azure.

1. Open the *Views/Home/Index.cshtml* file in **Solution Explorer**, change the **h1** heading from "ASP.NET" to "ASP.NET and Azure", and save the file.

	![MVC index.cshtml](./images/solution-explorer-index.png)

    _Index.cshtml_

	![MVC h1 change](./images/index-modification.png)

    _Changing the page's heading_

2. Press **CTRL+F5** to see the updated heading by running the site on your local computer.

	![Web App running locally](./images/running-localhost.png)

	_Web App running locally_

	The **http://localhost** URL shows that it's running on your local computer. By default it's running in IIS Express, which is a lightweight version of IIS designed for use during web application development.

3. Close the browser.

4. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, and choose **Publish**.

	![Chooose Publish](./images/second-publish.png)

    _Preparing a new deployment_

	The Preview tab of the **Publish Web** wizard appears. If you needed to change any publish settings you could choose a different tab, but now all you want to do is redeploy with the same settings.

5. In the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Publish**.

	![Click Publish](./images/click-publish-no-preview.png)

	_Publish Web Wizard_

	Visual Studio deploys the project to Azure and opens the site in the default browser.

	![Changed site deployed](./images/aspnet-and-azure.png)

	_Changes deployed_

	>**Tip:** You can enable the **Web One Click Publish** toolbar for even quicker deployment. Click **View** > **Toolbars**, and then select **Web One Click Publish**. The toolbar enables you to select a profile, click a button to publish, or click a button to open the **Publish Web** wizard.

	![Web One Click Publish Toolbar](./images/publish-toolbar.png)

    _Web One Click Publish Toolbar_

## Monitor and manage the site in the preview portal

The [Azure Preview Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) is a web interface that enables you to manage and monitor your Azure services, such as the App Service Web App you just created. In this task you will look at some of what you can do in the portal.

1. In your browser, go to [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your Azure credentials.

	The portal displays the home dashboard.

	On the left, click on **Browse** and then scroll down until you find **Web Apps**. Click on **Web Apps**.

	![Browse to Web Apps](./images/browse-to-web-apps.png)

2. Click the name of your Web App on the blade.

	![Web Apps blade with the Web App called out](./images/select-website.png)

    _Web Apps blade_

3. This blade gives you an overview of your Web App.

	You can access monitoring information, change the pricing tier, configure continuous deployment and various other tasks.

	![Web App overview blade](./images/web-app-overview-blade.png)

  	_Web App's overview blade_

	At this point your site hasn't had much traffic and may not show anything in the graph. If you browse to your application, refresh the page a few times, and then come back again, it will show up some traffic.

4. Click at **Settings** at the top of the blade. Then click **Application Settings**.

	The [Application Settings](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-configure/) blade enables you to control the .NET version used for the Web App, enable features such as [WebSockets](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2013/11/14/introduction-to-websockets-on-windows-azure-web-sites/) and [diagnostic logging](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-enable-diagnostic-log/), set [connection string values](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2013/07/17/windows-azure-web-sites-how-application-strings-and-connection-strings-work/), and more.

	![Portal Web App Application Settings blade ](./images/website-configure.png)

  	_WebApp's settings blade_

5. Click the **Scale** option, right below **Application Settings**.

	For the paid tiers of the Azure App Service, the [Scale](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-scale/) option enables you to control the size and number of machines that service your web application in order to handle variations in traffic.

	You can scale manually or configure criteria or schedules for automatic scaling.

	![Portal Web App scale options](./images/website-scale.png)

    _Web App's Scale Options_

	These are just a few of the management portal features. You can also create new App Service apps, delete existing apps, stop and restart apps, and manage other kinds of Azure services, such as databases and virtual machines.

##Appendix - Cleanup

In this task you will learn how to delete the Web App published in the previous section.

1. In your browser, go to [http://portal.azure.com](http://portal.azure.com), and sign in with your Azure credentials.

2. Click on **Browse** and scroll down until you see **Web Apps**. Click on **Web Apps**.

3. Select your Web App. The Web App blade should now be open.

4. Click **Delete** in the top bar.

	![Clicking Delete Web App](./images/clicking-delete-website.png?raw=true)

	_Clicking Delete to delete Web App_

5. In the **Delete app** confirmation dialog, click **Yes**.

	This will delete the Web App but it will keep the database intact. If you want to delete the database as well, follow the instructions below.

6. Click on **Browse** and scroll down until you see **SQL Databases**. Click on **SQL Databases**.

	![SQL Databases](./images/browse-to-sql-database.png)
	_Click SQL databases_

7. In the new **SQL Databases** blade, click on your database.

	The database blade should now be open.

8. Click on **Delete** from the top bar.

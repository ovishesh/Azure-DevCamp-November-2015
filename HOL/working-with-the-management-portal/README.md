3. Click **WEBSITE**. 

	Three options will be shown.

	- **QUICK CREATE**: This option will allow you to setup your website with the minimum amount of steps.

	> **Note:** The website URL has to be unique since it will be of public access.

## Managing allocated resources
In this task you will go through the available options for managing the recently created website.

1. If not already in the _Quick Start Management_ page, click the website's name to display it. 
	
	This page provides quick access to important actions related to managing the deployment of a site in Windows Azure. This is also the default landing page in the portal for a newly created website.

    ![_Website's Landing Page](images/website-quickstart.png?raw=true)

    _Website's Quickstart Management page_

2. Notice the commands located at the bottom of the page. These are:

    - **BROWSE**: To navigate to the current deployed version of the website
    - **STOP**: To stop the website's deployment
    - **RESTART**: To restart the website's deployment
    - **DELETE**: To delete the website
    - **WEBMATRIX**: Allows to install WebMatrix, Microsoft's new one-stop website authoring tool that lets you create, edit, and publish websites easily.

3. Look at the top bar to see the different sections available. These sections are:

    - Dashboard
	- Monitor
	- Webjobs
    - Configure
    - Scale
    - Linked Resources
    - Backups

	The rest of the task will describe the more important ones.
  
	> **Note**: For more information about all these options, see [Manage websites through the Azure Management Portal](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-manage/).
    
4. Click **DASHBOARD**. 

	The website's dashboard will show. This view will provide you with the most important information at a glance. Ranging from a health report to usage statistics, this view provides the core details of your service.

	![Website Clicked](images/website-dashboard-view.png?raw=true)

	_The Dashboard view_
    
5. On the top bar, click **MONITOR**. 

	This view allows the setup of tests to check the availability of HTTP or HTTPS endpoints, from up to three geo-distributed locations. A monitoring test fails if the HTTP response code is an error (4xx or 5xx) or the response takes more than 30 seconds. An endpoint is considered available if the monitoring tests succeed from all the specified locations.

	![Website Clicked](images/website-monitor-view.png?raw=true)

	_The Monitor view_
    
6. On the top bar, click **WEBJOBS**. 

	The WebJobs management page lets you create tasks for your website that can run on-demand, on a schedule or continuously.

	> **Note**: For more information regarding the use of Webjobs, see [How to Use the WebJobs feature in Microsoft Azure Web Sites](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-create-web-jobs/).

	_The Webjobs view_
    
7. Lastly, click **SCALE** on the top bar, to go to the scaling options. 

	For increased performance and throughput for your websites on Microsoft Azure, you can scale your Web Hosting Plan mode from Free to _Shared_, _Basic_, or _Standard_. Scaling up on Azure Websites involves two related actions: changing your _Web Hosting Plan_ mode to a higher level of service, and configuring certain settings after you have switched to the higher level of service. You can scale up or down as required. These changes take only seconds to apply and affect all websites in your Web Hosting Plan. They do not require your code to be changed or your applications to be redeployed.

	>
	>1. Click **DELETE** at the bottom of the page.
	>
	>![Clicking Delete website](images/clicking-delete-website.png?raw=true)

	>
	>![Delete Confirmation dialog](images/delete-confirmation-dialog.png?raw=true)
	>
	>_Delete Confirmation_
	>
	>After a few moments you should see a notification indicating the website was deleted. The website will not be listed under **WEBSITES** either.

Getting Started with Azure SQL Database Elastic Scale
=======================================================================================

Growing and shrinking capacity on demand is one of the key cloud computing promises. Delivering on this promise has historically been tedious and complex for the database tier of cloud applications. Over the last few years, the industry has converged on well-established design patterns commonly known as sharding. While the general sharding pattern addresses the challenge, building and managing applications using sharding requires significant infrastructure investments independent of the application’s business logic.

Azure SQL Database Elastic Scale (in preview) enables the data-tier of an application to scale in and out via industry-standard sharding practices, while significantly streamlining the development and management of your sharded cloud applications. Elastic Scale delivers both developer and management functionality which are provided through a set of .Net libraries and Azure service templates that you can host in your own Azure subscription to manage your highly scalable applications. Azure DB Elastic Scale implements the infrastructure aspects of sharding and thus allows you to focus on the business logic of your application instead.

In this lab, you will be introduced to the developer experience for Azure SQL Database Elastic Scale.

This lab includes the following tasks:

* [Creating a Microsoft Azure SQL Database Server](#creating-a-sql-server)
* [Walking through the sample](#walking-through-the-sample)
* [Appendix - Cleanup](#cleanup)

## Creating a Microsoft Azure SQL Database Server ##

In this task you will create a new Microsoft Azure SQL Database Server and configure the firewall so that connections from applications running on your computer are allowed to access the databases on your SQL Database server.

1. Sign in to the [Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com).

1. On the sidebar, click **SQL DATABASES**. Then click the **SERVERS** tab. 

	![Navigating to the SQL Database Servers tab](./images/navigating-to-the-sql-servers-tab.png)

	_Navigating to the SQL Database Server tab_

1. Click **ADD** in the bottom bar in order to create a new SQL Database Server.

	![Adding a new SQL Database Server](./images/adding-a-new-sql-server.png)

	_Adding a new SQL Database Server_

1. In the **CREATE SERVER** dialog box, fill out the Server Settings as follows:

	* **Login Name**: enter an administrator name as one word with no spaces. SQL Database uses SQL Authentication over an encrypted connection to validate user identity. A new SQL Server authentication login that has administrator permissions will be created using the name you provide. The administrator name cannot be a Windows user, nor should it be a Live ID user name. Windows authentication is not supported on SQL Database.

	* **Login Password**: provide a strong password that is at least eight characters, using a combination of upper and lower case values, and a number or symbol. Use the help bubble for details about password complexity.

	* **Region**: choose a region. The region determines the geographical location of the server. Regions cannot be easily switched, so choose one that makes sense for this server. Keeping your Azure application and database in the same region saves on egress bandwidth cost and data latency.

	* Be sure to keep the **Allow Azure Services to access this server**  checkbox selected so that you can connect to this database using the Management Portal for SQL Database, Excel in Office 365, or Azure SQL Reporting.

	Finally, click the checkmark button at the bottom of the dialog box to create the server. 

	Notice that you did not specify a server name. Because the SQL Database server must be accessible worldwide, SQL Database configures the appropriate DNS entries when the server is created. The generated name ensures that there are no name collisions with other DNS entries. You cannot change the name of your SQL Database server.

	![Creating a new SQL Database Server](./images/creating-a-sql-database-server.png)

	_Creating a new SQL Database Server_

1. Wait until the server has been created. You will see a notification like the one below and also an entry added to the **SQL databases** page.

	![SQL Database Server created](images/sql-database-server-created.png?raw=true)

	_SQL Database Server created_

	Now you will configure the firewall so that connections from applications running on your computer are allowed to access the databases on your SQL Database server.

	To configure the firewall so that connections are allowed through, you will enter information on the server page. 

	> **Note:** The SQL Database service is only available with TCP port 1433 used by the TDS protocol, so make sure that the firewall on your network and local computer allows outgoing TCP communication on port 1433. For more information, see [SQL Database Firewall](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/2677.sql-azure-firewall-en-us.aspx).

1. Click the server you just created to open the server page.

	![Navigating to the new server page](./images/navigating-to-the-new-server-page.png)

	_Navigating to the new server page_

1. On the server page, click **Configure** to open the **Allowed IP Addresses** settings. Then click **Add to the allowed IP Addresses** link. 

	This will create a new firewall rule to allow connection requests from the router or proxy server your device is listening on.

	![Adding a firewall rule to the server](./images/adding-a-firewall-rule.png)

	_Adding a firewall rule to the server_

	> **Note:** You can create additional firewall rules by specifying a rule name and the start and end IP range values.

1. To save your changes, click **SAVE** at the bottom of the page.

	![Saving the allowed ip changes](./images/saving-the-allowed-ip-changes.png)

	_Saving the allowed ip changes_

1. Take note of the name of the SQL Database server (e.g.: _z754axd2q8_), as you will need it in the following task.

You now have a SQL Database server on Azure, a firewall rule that enables access to the server, and an administrator login.
